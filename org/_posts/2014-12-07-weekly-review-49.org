Last week, I said I will start to 

1. track my time 60/24/7,
2. daily review Stats consultancy project,
3. revise stats notes from Uni 

** Quantified-Self 
During the last two month, I have been denoting myself to build up a plantomfm so I can eaily track my time - every minute I spent at home, library and office, using Emacs and org mode. 
When I was away from a keyboard (i.e computer) I will use [[http://dayoneapp.com][Day One]] to track my time, most likely when I going out. An tracking journal would be like this:

#+begin_example
1132, start to write 
1432, shopping 
1510, chat with a friend 
1559, take a nap 
1626, wake, walk to a friend's house 
have dinner until 1832 
#+end_example

Each night, I spent 10-30 minute to transfer the tracking journal to org entries format. I find this process is particularly tedious, because for each activities, I need to 
1. create a heading, 
1. clock in and out,
2. navigate to clock entry and change the time (and date sometimes) four times,
3. refile to the entry to the right org file. 

I came up with a style and use R process the tracking journal to org entries format automatically, but I feel typing on iPhone is a pain and  decide to go back to use [[http://www.atimelogger.com][aTimeLogger]]. It is very user friendly - I can create a whiteboard of whatever tasks I want to record, with a nice icon, as shown beloe
[[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/43889494/2014-12-07%2018.31.18.png][a image]]
All I need to do is press the icon and it will begin to clock. On the top, it shows what has been clocking and for how long. I press the red button when it's done, and it will promote to ask me writ comments. 

The killing point of this app is that it allows you to export a CSV file for a specific date range. Each night, i will 
1. export today's entries to a CSV file, 
2. fire up R and load the CSV file, run a function, 
3. copy the output (complete org entries with clock entires) to a .org file and begin to refile. 

I am quit enjoy this workflow, it makes my life a lot easier. In the near future I want to explore the possibility of automating the refile step. 

** New Habit 

For some reason, I fond myself not being distracted easier. This character noramlly is a good thing, but for me, it was to been a extrened that beging a really bad thing. I constantly found myself being trap in a technical problems for 2-3 hours, usually resulting in a unproductive morning or afternoon. 


I am a statistician, had a math degree and enjoy problem-solving. I have been working on many difficulty problem (not necessary for others but deifnitely for me) like teach myself Emacs/org-mode, R and C++11. Whenever I confront a problem, my brain is stimulate and i got excited, will dive in and be ready to fight to death. It is a character that I'm proud of. Sometimes, the problem was out of my reach, and i found myself being trapped there for 2-3 hours, sometimes even days, and can't get anything valueble out of it. 


I use org mode to help me to form a good habits: i will tell myself to stop and re-assess the problem if I've been working for then 90 minutes on a single tasks. The clocking time can be see very easiler in modeline. If that happen, i will start to write a report about 1) what's the problem, 2) what've done, 3) what's value solution. It will gives a time to claim down and writing it down in words really helps to undertand the problem deeper, and break down the problems into small tasks and seek for help.
