<p>
Last week, I said I will start to
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>track my time 60/24/7,
</li>
<li>daily review on Stats Consultancy project
</li>
<li>revise stats notes in Uni
</li>
<li>I have been using Day One to track my time when I was away from keyboard, most likely when I hangout with friends. An tracking journal would be like this:
</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
1132, start to write 
1432, shopping 
1510, chat with a friend 
1559, take a nap 
1626, wake, walk to a friend's house 
have dinner until 1832
</pre>

<p>
Then during the night, i would spent 10-30 minute to transfer org entries, I find this process is particularlly tedious, because for each entry, i need to
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>clock in and out,
</li>
<li>navigate to clock entry and change the time (and date sometimes) four times,
</li>
<li>refile to entries to the right org file.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I managed to write R scripts to prase the journal to org entries automatically, the main problems is typeiing on iPhone, and i decieded to go back to use aTimeLogger. I set-up the most frequency acitivities, like eat-breakfast, eat-lunch, â€¦, commute, sleep etc. All I need to do is press the coressponding bottom and it will begin to clock, and when it's done, i will write note few words. During the night, i will
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>export today's entries to a CSV file,
</li>
<li>fire up R and load the CSV file, run a function,
</li>
<li>copy the output (complete org entries with clock entires) to a .org file and begin to refile.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
I am quit enjoy this workflow at this moment, it makes my life a lot esaier, and I also want to explore the possibliyf of automating the refile step.
</p>

<p>
For some reason, I fond myself not being distracted easier. This character noramlly is a good thing, but for me, it was to been a extrened that beging a really bad thing. I constantly found myself being trap in a technical problems for 2-3 hours, usually resulting in a unproductive morning or afternoon.
</p>

<p>
I am a statistician, had a math degree and enjoy problem-solving. I have been working on many difficulty problem (not necessary for others but deifnitely for me) like teach myself Emacs/org-mode, R and C++11. Whenever I confront a problem, my brain is stimulate and i got excited, will dive in and be ready to fight to death. It is a character that I'm proud of. Sometimes, the problem was out of my reach, and i found myself being trapped there for 2-3 hours, sometimes even days, and can't get anything valueble out of it.
</p>

<p>
I use org mode to help me to form a good habits: i will tell myself to stop and re-assess the problem if I've been working for then 90 minutes on a single tasks. The clocking time can be see very easiler in modeline. If that happen, i will start to write a report about 1) what's the problem, 2) what've done, 3) what's value solution. It will gives a time to claim down and writing it down in words really helps to undertand the problem deeper, and break down the problems into small tasks and seek for help.
